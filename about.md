#### Command Line Tips

This is a series of bite-sized command line tips.  Despite the imperative nature of the tip titles, feel free to take them as suggestions.  The goal of this blog is to encourage learning and help people (including myself) get more out of the command line.  If anything here is not helpful feel free to ignore it.
